## Sample Title: **[INSERT ORGANIZATION NAME]** Joins the Nationwide Blue Button Campaign to Empower Consumers to Be Partners in Their Health

This national campaign is raising awareness about Blue Button and how consumers can exercise their [rights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-wV23_E4eQ) to get and use their own health information. We need people like you to be actively engaged in managing your health because after all, you are responsible for the majority of the choices that actually impact it, like when and where you seek health treatment, what you eat, whether you take your medications as prescribed, whether you smoke, etc. This campaign is about helping you to reach your own health goals.

As a starting point, by using Blue Button, we are arming you with easier access to your information so you are better positioned to work with your doctors and others to successfully care for you or your loved ones. In addition to getting your records from **[INSERT ORGANIZATION NAME]**, you can also learn about other sources where you can get your health data by going to the [Blue Button Connector website](http://bluebuttonconnector.healthit.gov/). This websites also offers apps that can help you to interpret and use your electronic health records.

To help spread the word about Blue Button access to health data via the Blue Button Campaign, in the upcoming months **[INSERT ORGANIZATION NAME]** will be doing **[LIST COMMITMENTS]**. In September, we will be running public service announcements our home page of our website along with organizations across the country to further get the word out about Blue Button **[ONLY INCLUDE IF THAT IS A COMMITMENT]**.

We are thrilled to be a part of this important Campaign. With Blue Button, people like you are being empowered to reach their own health goals – and even improve the health of the nation along the way. To learn more about the campaign, visit www.healthit.gov/bluebutton.
