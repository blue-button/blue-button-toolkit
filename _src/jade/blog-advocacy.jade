            h3 Sample Title: [INSERT ORGANIZATION NAME] Joins the Nationwide Blue Button Campaign to Empower Consumers to Be Partners in Their Health
            p.fs-small Do you struggle to remember answers to questions like: What medications are you on? Do you know where to find the vaccination history for you or your children? Have you ever had any surgical procedures done? How long ago? Do you have a family history of heart disease?
            p.fs-small You are not alone! Yet, giving the wrong answers to these questions could be fatal, especially in an emergency.
            p.fs-small Technology can change this by enabling you to get your information electronically to help you manage your health and health care, and that of your family. In support of greater patient and consumer empowerment, [INSERT ORGANIZATION NAME] is pleased to be joining the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a new initiative called the Blue Button Campaign.
            p.fs-small Just what exactly is Blue Button? Blue Button is a symbol that lets patients and caregivers know they can securely get their health information electronically. Your health information may be stored in many places, such as with physicians, hospitals, diagnostic labs, pharmacies, and state immunization registries. Until recently, much of this information, particularly within doctor’s offices and hospitals, was on paper. Fortunately, new federal laws and programs are making it easier for health care providers to switch from paper files to electronic health records.
